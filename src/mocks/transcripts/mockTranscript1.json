Look at the sales of High Noon for example."

You’re arguing that shifting to hard seltzer makes sense because beer demand is declining, and seltzer is growing, especially with younger consumers.\n\nI’ll take the position that they should focus on high-quality beer instead.\n\nNow, let me challenge your stance: While hard seltzer is growing, it's also becoming extremely crowded. Big players like White Claw and Truly dominate, and even Bud Light jumped in. How would Brooklyn differentiate and protect its margins in such a crowded market, especially when they have a strong, established identity in craft beer?\n\nWhat’s your counter-argument to that?"
